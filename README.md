This is a project which aims at extracting and querying text from an image containing text(OCR). Libraries majorly used are pytesseract and transformers!

Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Tesseract-OCR, an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine maintained by Google.
OCR is a technology that enables machines to recognize text within images. 
Pytesseract makes it easy to use Tesseract-OCR in Python applications by providing a simple interface to interact with the Tesseract engine.

Hugging Face's Transformers library is an open-source library that provides a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the Transformer architecture.
It has pre-trained models, pipeline API, tokenizer. Pipeline API allows users to easily perform common NLP tasks without the need for extensive coding or model configuration. With just a few lines of code, users can set up pipelines for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, translation, summarization, and more.

Pillow adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
This library provides extensive file format support, powerful image processing capabilities, and simple yet powerful image manipulation tools.
